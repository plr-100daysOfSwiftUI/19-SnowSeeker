[Hacking with Swift: 100 Days of SwiftUI - Project 19][1]

### Challenges

1. Add a photo credit over the ResortView image. The data is already loaded from the JSON for this purpose, so you just need to make it look good in the UI.
2. Fill in the loading and saving methods for Favorites.
3. For a real challenge, let the user sort and filter the resorts in ContentView. For sorting use default, alphabetical, and country, and for filtering let them select country, size, or price.
